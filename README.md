# CelestaPowerLog
1. Follow the instructions on [CELESTA and CELESTA quattro Light Engine® Instruction Manual](https://cms.lumencor.com/system/uploads/fae/file/asset/48/57-10015-F_Celesta_09092021.pdf) (3.3.3 Ethernet Connection and Control GUI) to set up LAN communication with the onboard computer.
2. Run this script on PowerShell (you might need to [change execution policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies) to allow the script to be run). It requires one parameter input to specify the laser line to be logged. For example, to log laser line #4 (corresponding to the 545-nm line; note that the numbering starts from 0):
```
LogLaserPower.ps1 4
```
3. The log file will be on the current user's desktop with a date tag. It is suggested to add the exposure time information (of the channel that used this laser line in your experiment setup) manually to the name of the log file.
4. Each line in the log contains the following information: **hour**(24-h clock)**:min:second**(1-ms accuracy)**,power**(in milliwatts). During most of the time, the laser will not be on (so the output power will simply be 0). Therefore, all 0's are ignored and not logged. The default interval between inquiries is 25 ms (which does not include the latency due to communication and internal processing). To set this value differently, change the value of ``$Interval`` in the code.
5. Run the MATLAB® function ``reconstitutePulse`` using the log file to visually examine the average half pulse. The reconstitution is based on the calculation of the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) and the assumption that all pulses from an experiment session are equivalent and symmetrical about their peak. The shape of the average half pulse will be distorted by measurement errors and smoothed by the fact that the readout of instantaneous powers can never actually be instantaneous. The horizontal axis can only be roughly regarded as a normalized time axis.
