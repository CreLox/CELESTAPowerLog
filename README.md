# CelestaPowerLog
1. Follow the instructions on CELESTA and CELESTA quattro Light EngineÂ® Instruction Manual (3.3.3 Ethernet Connection and Control GUI) to set up the LAN communication with the onboard computer.

2. Run this script on PowerShell. It requires one parameter input to specify the laser line to be logged. For example, to log laser line #4 (corresponding to the 545-nm line):
```
LogLaserPower.ps1 4
```

3. The log file will be on the current user's desktop with a date tag. The default interval between inquiries is 25 ms (which does not include the latency due to communication and internal processing). To set this value differently, change the value of ``$Interval`` in the code.
